            <br>Dear Diary:
            <p>&emsp;&emsp; Today was <i>disappointing</i>. Even though the hunt went well, that <em>bonelicker</em>
            <span style="color:yellowgreen"><b>Thynee Peepy</b></span> took all the credits. He stole
            my prey made the entire pack thought it was him who brought it down. Only my sweet <span style="color:yellowgreen">
            <b>Clawdia Dymore</b></span> knew the what happened. She tried to tell the truth but no one believed her.
            Everyone praised him like he's the brightest star in the night sky, but my favorite spark of the 
            black veil is not that one. It's the tiny one that's getting bigger every night. It's a lot like me.
            We both started out small but grew steadily. Soon I will  challenge that scaley bastard.
            I'll show everyone that I'm the real pack leader.</p>

            It's all thanks you, my friend in the sky. You have granted me your blessings.

            <br>Dear Diary:
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;This is it. I can feel my time coming to an end. I've led a good life.
            <span style="color:yellowgreen"><b>Clawdia</b></span> has already gone ahead and I shall follow soon.
            The rest of my packs are scattered, swallowed by the ashes.
            My glimmering friend from the black veil, how could have I known that you are here to take me away?
            Reunite me with my beloved <span style="color:yellowgreen"><b>Clawdia</b></span>.</p>

            That was the last known entry of <span style="color:yellowgreen"><b>Bidey Gonsuun's</b></span> journal.
            The future did not unfold the way as he predicted. No doubt, his pack would have had a wonderful
            future, but this is the true future.
